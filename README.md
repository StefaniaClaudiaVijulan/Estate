# Estate
Implementation of an application that allows the management of customers and properties real estate within a newly established real estate agency. The name of the client is known for each home who rents it, usable area and discount (0-10%). In the apartments you know the floor, and in the houses you know how many square meters does the yard have, how many floors does the house have and what is the usable area on each floor. Obviously, the rent calculation is done differently. If at the apartments is considered only the formula given by the price of rent per square meter * usable area, taking care to apply discount where appropriate, at home, it is add, regardless of the discount, the price per square meter of yard * its surface.
